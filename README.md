# UNISWAP 
Uniswap V2 is a decentralized Exchange, running on the Ethereum Blockchain, used for trading ERC20 tokens. 


## What Does Uniswap Do?
There are 2 types of users:
- Liquidity Providers:
Liquidity Providers provide the pool with the 2 tokens that can be exchanged. We will call them Token0 and Token1. 
In return, they receive a third token that represents partial ownership of the pool called a Liquidity Token.


- Traders
Traders send one type of token to the pool and receive the other. The exchange rate is determined by the reltive number of Token0s and Token1s that the pool has. 
In addition, the pool takes a small percent as a reward for the liquidity pool.
